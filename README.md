# despresso

A new app for the decent de1 espresso machine.
It is intended to be running on Android and iOS with a direct BLE connection to the decent machine.

## Getting Started

This project is using Flutter as a development framework.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

The app is prepared to use fastlane deployment - this is limited in the way that you need to have the required signatures and keys for signing and uploading to the appstore.

For a normal build it should just work.
